Add	a	shell	command,	kill	<pid>,	to	kill	an	active	process.
|-> How kill??? Just delete PID from ready queue and PCB from resident queue??

Develop	a	CPU	scheduler	in	the	client	OS	using	Round	Robin	scheduling	
with	the	user-speciWied	quantum	measured	in	clock	ticks	(default	=	6).	
• Make	the	client	OS	control	the	host	CPU	with	the	CPU	scheduler.	
• Log	all	scheduling	events.	

Implement	context	switches	with	software	interrupts.		Be	sure	to	update	
the	mode	bit	(if	appropriate),	the	PCBs,	and	the	Ready	queue.	

Delete processes from the ready queue that after running.

SEE TODOs IN SHELL.JS
-- Should I add base to the memory locations I am given?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[optional]	Track	turnaround	time	and	wait	time	for	each	process.

Project 4 - Use session storage, not local storage
|-> Track 0 Sector 0 Block 0 is the MBR
|-> Track 0 for directory
|-> Rest are used for Data

We will use chaining to link code in hard drive file code together
